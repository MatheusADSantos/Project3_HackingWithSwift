Project 3
The famous Brazilian author Paulo Coelho said, “Twitter is my bar: I sit at the counter and listen to the conversations, starting others, feeling the atmosphere.” Whether you use it much or not, social media is a massive driving force for change in our world.

For app developers, social media is also a chance for our users to talk about our app: to share things they’ve found, or perhaps just to tell the world how much they love it. It helps break the feeling that our app is contained to their device – if we can help them communicate with friends online, they’ll thank us for it.

So, today you’re going to meet your first technique project: a project specifically dedicated to teaching one specific iOS or Swift skill. This will sometimes involve new projects, and other times involve changing existing projects, but you’ll always learn something new.

Today you have three topics to work through, and you’ll meet UIBarButtonItem and UIActivityViewController. Once that’s done, complete the chapter review, then work through all three of its challenges.
